JavaScript is a powerful language that fuels the modern web, servers, and desktop development environments.

In web development, JavaScript is essential for building both front-end and back-end applications. It's the language you use to interact with web pages and create dynamic content.

 JavaScript ecosystem:
Vanilla JavaScript: This is the core scripting language for the web. It's what you write when you're working with JavaScript directly.
ECMAScript: This is the official description of how JavaScript should be interpreted by browsers, ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms.
TypeScript: TypeScript is a variation of JavaScript often used in modern frameworks. It adds features like static typing to enhance code quality.
JavaScript Frameworks: Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular simplify web development by providing tools and structures to build applications more efficiently.
Node.js: JavaScript has expanded beyond the browser to the server-side with Node.js. It allows you to write JavaScript code that runs on servers, enabling full-stack development with a single language.
For coding convenience, tools like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Prettier help with code formatting and readability. These tools ensure that your code is organized and easy to understand.



Fundamentals of the JavaScript Language
From Top to Bottom
Write JavaScript from top to bottom because that is how the browser will read it. A good rule of thumb is to define early on all variables, functions and objects, and anything else before you use them.
Comments
Comments are used as markers for yourself and others of what is going on. When you create a comment, the browser ignores it entirely, meaning you can leave as many as you like. //Insert Comment -You can do that on its own line or you can also do it inside another line of code
